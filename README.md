This project is clonning flickr for an academic project.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

For help getting started with our Flickr app, view our
[documentation](in the doc folder), which offers a complete
 guidance on the widgets, functionsand models used, and a full API reference.

 This project is done using the MVVM archeticture where you can find the 
 models in the [Models] folder, the view models in the [View_Model] folder
  and the design in the [View] folder
